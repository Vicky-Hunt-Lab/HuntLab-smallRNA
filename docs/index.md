# Welcome to the Hunt Lab Small RNA Pipeline Documentation

This tool is designed to automate a lot of the common bioinformatics performed on small RNA by the [Hunt Lab](https://www.vickyhuntlab.org/). It is deliberately designed to be highly configurable so it can be easily applied to a wide range of scenarios, though most of our work is on nematode and nematomorph worms.
